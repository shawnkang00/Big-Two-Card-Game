/**
 * This hand consists of five cards with consecutive ranks. For the sake of simplicity, 2 and A can only form a straight with K but not with 3. 
 * The card with the highest rank in a straight is referred to as the top card of this straight. A straight having a top card with a higher rank beats a straight having a top card with a lower rank. 
 * For straights having top cards with the same rank, the one having a top card with a higher suit beats the one having a top card with a lower suit.
